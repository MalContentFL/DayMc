# **DayMc**
*DayMc* is a new modpack built around loot and territory. It is heavily inspired by *DayZ* and *Escape From Tarkov*, and the *Invasion* modpack by Darkosto.

My goal is to recreate the survival aspects from these games in Minecraft.
This pack aims to be lightweight in order to support larger player counts and smooth performance. We'll see how far that goes :/

### Loot:
The pack is loot-centric and requires much more exploration than mining or crafting.
Loot can be found in many places. Loot is gotten from chests, mobs and dungeons. It comes in many tiers, and each tier becomes available as you progress through the tech tree, all guided by the custom Hardcore Questing Mode book! Loot can be bartered and bought from NPCs as well.

### Your Base:
Claim land to build a base and store your gear. Protect your base from players and AI raiders/mobs.
Loot in loot crates respawns daily. Every 3-5 days, an airdrop is dropped over the map. It has very good gear.

### Locations:
Each location has a difficulty which determines mob types, spawn rates, and loot. The locations spawns in towns, similar to 7 Days To Die, but also spawn alone in the wilderness. Just a few of them include:
- Bunker
- Hideout
- Farm
- Military Base with walls, helipad, and watchtowers
- Crashed Helicopter/Plane
- Duplex
- Gas Station

### Classes:
Players can choose one of many classes.

### Looting:
Every item has a different loot tier. Visit locations, kill certain mobs, and get airdrops to attain certain gear.

### Blocks:
Much harder to obtain/craft/harvest.

### Worldgen:
World has layers of stone requiring higher mining levels to get to rare ores. Caves are very rare.

### Mods:
Here are the core mods to the pack
- Air Support: Airdrops with callin remotes
- Biomes O’ Plenty
- Lost Cities: City generator
- Epic Siege Mod: Advanced Mob AI. TWEAK CONFIG!
- HQM: Questing Mod
- Health and Hunger Tweaks
- Good Old Currency: Currency Mod

- Raiders: AI Raiders. 5 different classes

### Late Game: 
As you progress along the pack, new mods will become available. When you've master Immersive Engineering and have completed the main quest series, soon you'll look to the skies for an escape from this unforgiving planet. Advanced Rocketry will bring you to the stars, with rockets built with the power of Refined Storage.
